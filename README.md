<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
## Project Description

Field Finder is a web application that lets you search for Majors and
Institutions offered nationwide. Each of these paths to knowledge opens up
a world of opportunity.
We have a feature "Major Quiz" from which a user will answer the
questions and based on the answers, majors will be suggested. This will
help them choose a career path. We have a another feature "Merit
Calculator" that lets you calculate your merit for different universities in
Pakistan. This can help narrowing down options.
